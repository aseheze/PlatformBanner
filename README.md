# PlatformBanner
I made up a Netflix crime series called  "Partly Criminal"  which is about 
a mysterious murder where there are no suspects. However, later a suspect 
is found and surprisingly they are involved in this murder without them noticing. 

Therefore the design of my banner revolves around the idea that the suspect 
is both innocent and guilty which is symbolized by the face of the figure 
that is half-white and half-black. Additionally, I decided to do a minimal design 
that is overall inspired by the other Netflix banners.

Moreover, the interaction happens when you click on the "watch now" box. You come across 
an animation where some body parts of the figure change from black to white which again 
points out the innocence of the suspect, however, ends up with a black and white 
prisoner outfit which also shows their guilty side.
